### ðŸ‘‹ Hello there!

I'm a software engineer with a strong background in mathematics.
I'm passionate about building projects that bridge the gap between math and technology.
Whether it's data science, machine learning, or software architecture, I thrive on applying mathematical ideas to solve real-world problems.

My deepest interest lies in creating tools for **applied topology** and **topological data analysis**.
These fields let me explore the rich intersection of mathematical structure and practical application, uncovering hidden patterns and insights in complex data.

I'm always excited to collaborate with engineers, researchers, and data enthusiasts to build innovative, math-driven solutions.

- ðŸ“š **Education**: PhD in Mathematics, with a focus on algebra and geometry
- ðŸ’» **Experience**: Backend engineer, specializing in real-time data-intensive applications
